Welcome to AllSeen Lighting Service Framework
==============================================

Building the Lighting Service Framework core modules on Ubuntu
==============================================================
1) Follow the instructions in https://allseenalliance.org/docs-and-downloads/documentation/configuring-build-environment-linux-platform to set up your ubuntu machine to build AllJoyn

2) You will need the following directory structure in your working directory.

core/

	service_framework/   (https://git.allseenalliance.org/cgit/lighting/service_framework.git Commit ID: 2e04a5afea1685e065483ade14510a6f1acf0380 i.e. Tag: v14.12)

	ajtcl/   (https://git.allseenalliance.org/cgit/core/ajtcl.git Commit ID: af24e93af4d6cd55aae8a2b97635d8004fdae8c6)

	alljoyn/ (https://git.allseenalliance.org/cgit/core/alljoyn.git Commit ID:108de2eff845662cd41558c1939cd9d17410f711 i.e. Tag: v14.12b)

base_tcl/ (https://git.allseenalliance.org/cgit/services/base_tcl.git Commit ID:c0867c9bd03680197a811ee462247eaaed7011cb)

base/ (https://git.allseenalliance.org/cgit/services/base.git Commit ID:a9a6489ebc8eb6ce1a57d78b16ea0ad794fcf048)

3) Open a command terminal and from under the core/service_framework/ directory, run the command "scons" to build the core modules

=====================================================================================================
Running the End-To-End Test on Ubuntu
=====================================================================================================

From under the directory core/service_framework/build/linux/x86/debug/dist/cpp/bin, run the alljoyn daemon using the following command:

./alljoyn-daemon

This will start a daemon that will support a max of 32 Lamp Services.

You could run the following command instead to specify a custom config file that will allow up to 100 Lamp Services

./alljoyn-daemon --config-file=./routerconfig.xml

This will start the Routing Node

Now on another terminal, from under the directory core/service_framework/build/linux/thin_core_library/lamp_service/bin, run the lamp service using the following command:

./lamp_service

You could also use the shell script LaunchLampServices.sh that can be found in the core/service_framework/build/linux/thin_core_library/lamp_service/bin directory to launch from 1 up to a 100 Lamp Services on Ubuntu. Run the following command from under the core/service_framework/build/linux/thin_core_library/lamp_service/bin directory

./LaunchLampServices.sh

The script will then prompt you to enter the number of Lamp Services to launch. Enter the number and then press enter.

Please note that the script launches the lamp services as background processes and also creates a number of directories. In order to ensure that the script cleans those up properly on exit, use Ctrl+C to exit the script. The script will then prompt you to press enter. Once you do so, all the directories and background processes are cleaned up. If this process is not followed to exit the script, you would need to explicitly clean up all the lamp services and directories.

This script is provided AS-IS mainly for use by the dev team and any bugs filed against this script will not be supported.

In a third terminal, from under the directory core/service_framework/build/linux/standard_core_library/lighting_controller_service/bin, run the Lighting Controller Service:

./lighting_controller_service

The lighting controller service optionally accepts the following parameters. If no parameters are specified, defaults are used.

    -h                    = Print this help message

    -?                    = Print this help message

    -f                    = Run the Controller Service as a foreground process

    -k <absolute_directory_path>   = The absolute path to a directory required to store the AllJoyn KeyStore, Persistent Store and read/write the Config FilePaths

    -v                    = Print the version number and exit

    -r                    = Override the rank for debugging purposes

    -l                    = Enable background logging

 
Please note that AllJoyn/Controller Service by default prepend this path with the home directory path. So for example if the absolute path to a directory is

home/padmapri/workspace/core/service_framework where $HOME = /home/padmapri/, the application only needs to pass in workspace/core/service_framework i.e.

./lighting_controller_service -k workspace/core/service_framework

As regards the home directory path, if $HOME is specified in the environment, that is considered as the path or if this is absent “/” is considered as home.

In a fourth terminal, from under the directory core/service_framework/build/linux/standard_core_library/lighting_controller_client/samples, run the Lighting Controller Client Test App:

./lighting_controller_client_sample

The Lighting Controller Client Test App should provide a drop down menu of commands that you can exercise to run the end to end samples. You should also see the replies and the signals received back from the Controller Service on the terminal running the Lighting Controller Client Test App.

NOTE: In order to verify ApplyScene and ApplyMasterScene,

Bring up 20 lamp services using the LaunchLampServices.sh script
Run the commands in the following order in the Lighting Controller Client Sample

(3):   GetAllLampIDs

(39):  CreateLampGroup (This will automatically create 8 sample Lamp Groups)

(63):  CreatePreset (Run Create Preset twice to create 2 presets as this is required by Create Scene)

(63):  CreatePreset

(70):  CreateScene (This will Create a sample Scene with the existent Lamp IDs and already created Lamp Groups and Presets)

(74):  ApplyScene

(78):  CreateMasterScene (This will Create a sample Master Scene with the already created Scene)

(82):  ApplyMasterScene

This lighting controller client sample is provided AS-IS mainly for use by the dev team and any bugs filed against this program will not be supported.

Enabling Logging in Lighting Controller Service and Lighting Controller Client
In all the *.cc files under the src directories in the core/service_framework/standard_core_library, you will find a #define QCC_MODULE for that file.

For Eg: in core/service_framework/standard_core_library/lighting_controller_service/src/ControllerService.cc it is #define QCC_MODULE "CONTROLLER_SERVICE"

To enable logging from the file ControllerService.cc, use the following command when running the Controller Service

ER_DEBUG_CONTROLLER_SERVICE=7 ./lighting_controller_service

    You can pass in multiple ER_DEBUG env variables when starting the Controller Service or Controller Client.

For Eg: ER_DEBUG_CONTROLLER_SERVICE=7 ER_DEBUG_LAMP_CLIENTS=7 ./lighting_controller_service

    Use ER_DEBUG_ALL=7 to enable all logging. But this would also enable all AllJoyn logging and result in lot of logs. If using ER_DEBUG_ALL dump the logs to a log file as below:

ER_DEBUG_ALL=7 ./lighting_controller_service 2> log.txt
